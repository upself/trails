		<p>
		<b><a name="Q2">Where did the data in BRAVO come from?</a></b><br/>
		Account information comes directly from the asset management
		<a href="http://tap.raleigh.ibm.com/OSCAR/welcome.do">Customer Number Database</a>, 
		this is the tool used across all asset management applications to ensure standardization on 
		account names and account information. Installed software data is collected through automated 
		scans using TCM, TLM, SMS Altiris, and Marimba or through the upload of scan data from the 
		<a href="http://tap.raleigh.ibm.com/standalone/ ">standalone script</a> or 
		<a href="http://tap.raleigh.ibm.com/mainframe/">Tivoli License Compliance Manager</a> 
		(formerly SoftAudit). Hardware data is loaded from the Asset Tracking and Planning (ATP) database.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q3"> How frequent will data from ATP be loaded?</a></b><br/>
		ATP will feed the BRAVO application periodically throughout the day and will update the tool at a 
		minimum of once a day.

		<b><a name="Q1">What is BRAVO?</a></b><br/>
		The Baseline Repository and Asset Validation Operation (BRAVO) tool is a web based asset management tool
		that reports installed software data from automated scans which are linked to hardware baseline data.
		Additionally, the tool functions as an input for validation of installed software by technical teams and
		subject matter experts.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q4">How are the technical teams involved in the tool?</a></b><br/>
		Technical groups such as system administrators utilize the tool to upload scan data, validate 
		installed software, and pull installed software reports.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q5">How is asset management involved in the tool?</a></b><br/>
		Asset management is responsible for verifying software is validated prior to the annual software 
		reconciliation where needed, ensuring that the hardware baseline data is accurate, and resolving 
		software discrepancies entered by the technical teams through signature bank updates or working 
		with development teams to update the scanning tools.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q6">How will I be able to know if I have collected installed SW scans for all of the machines that I need?</a></b><br/>
		All installed software data and hardware data will be loaded into the BRAVO tool. The tool will provide 
		reporting to see which machines need scan data and which scans do not have proper hardware records.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q7">Will installed software scans from the prior year be acceptable for this year?s software reconciliation?</a></b><br/>
		Scan data will typically be stored in the asset management infrastructure for one full year (per scan time) 
		before being removed, however, only scans from the current year will be loaded into the TRAILS system for 
		use with a reconciliation.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="Q8"> What do I do if a scan finds software that is invalid or is a false software hit?</a></b><br/>
		While automated scans are the best source of installed software data that we can collect, there are times 
		where software will be identified inaccurately. To correct these issues, the technical teams as well as 
		asset managers will be able to submit discrepancies against the data. Once a discrepancy is on file in 
		BRAVO we can act on it to correct it for future scans. Until the data is corrected the discrepancy will 
		ensure that invalid or false software hits are not part of the software reconciliation.
