		<b><a name="H6"> Search Results Table Help</a></b><br/>
		Results returned: The tool will, by default, return only hardware records that are listed as "Active" 
		in the hardware baseline or assets where the status is not populated in the hardware baseline. By
		clicking the "Show All" link above the results you can see assets with a status of "Inactive", 
		"HWCOUNT", or "Removed" (where the asset was removed from the hardware baseline previously). The tool 
		will also only return software scan that are active. Inactive or removed scans will not be displayed in 
		in the tool.<br/><br/>

		LPAR Name: Name of machine, otherwise known as hostname, machine name, node name, etc. <br/>

		Serial: Serial number of asset from hardware baseline<br/><br/>
		Hardware: <br/>
		<i>View Details</i> - A hardware record for this machine name exists in the hardware baseline 
		and clicking this will allow you to see the details of the machine. <br/>
		<i>No HW Record</i> - A Hardware record does not exist for this hostname, clicking this will 
		allow you to create a discrepancy (placeholder) for the hardware asset record until the baseline 
		can be updated in the source system. <br/>
		<i>Discrepancy</i> - A Hardware record does not exist for this hostname in the baseline but a 
		place holder discrepancy has been entered. Clicking on this will provide you with the details 
		of the asset. This hardware record should be updated in the hardware baseline system. <br/><br/>
		Software: <br/>
		<i>View Details</i> - Installed software record(s) for this machine name do exist in the software 
		baseline and clicking this will allow you to see the details of the machine. <br/>
		<i>No SW Records</i> - Software record(s) do not exist for this hostname, clicking this will take 
		you to the details for the asset record. Scan data or missing software discrepancies should be 
		added to BRAVO for this asset. <br/>
		ATP Status: This is the hardware deployment status from the hardware baseline. This will be either "Active", 
		"Inactive", "HWCOUNT", "Removed", or not displayed if not populated in the hardware baseline.<br/>

		<i>Create HW LPAR Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to create a placeholder for a hardware record 
		that is missing from the baseline. This discrepancy record is required in order to upload a SoftAudit 
		of VM file to the system when there is no hardware LPAR record for the asset. <br/>
		<i>View HW LPAR Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to view the HW LPAR record that is in place. <br/>
		<i>Update HW Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to view the HW LPAR record that is in place and make 
		any needed update to the discrepancy record. <br/>
		<br/>
		<i>Create SW Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to create a missing software discrepancy for a product 
		that is not listed currently under the LPAR. You will be able to search on the correct product name from 
		the catalog and enter in additional information to help future scans locate the product such as signature 
		file name and byte size. <br/>
		<i>Update Software Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to view the installed software discrepancy record 
		that is in place and make any needed update to the discrepancy record. <br/>
		<br/>
		<i>Create New Account Contact</i> - This will allow you to enter in a technical contact responsible for 
		the account. You will be able to do a search from blue pages and select the contact name for your search 
		results. <br/>
		<i>Refresh/Remove Existing Account Contacts</i> - This will allow you to update the contact names 
		information from Blue Pages or remove one of the contact names from the list. <br/>
		<i>Create New LPAR Contact</i> - This will allow you to enter in a technical contact responsible for the 
		specific LPAR. You will be able to do a search from blue pages and select the contact name for your search 
		results. <br/>
		<i>Refresh/Remove Existing LPAR Contacts</i> - This will allow you to update the contact names information 
		from Blue Pages or remove one of the contact names from the list. <br/>
		<i>Edit HW Contacts</i> - TBD<br/>
		<br/>
		<i>Upload TCM Script TAR File</i> - This will allow you to upload a .TAR file created from multiple .TAR.Z scan 
		resutls files directly to the asset management server. The file will go into a queue for loading to the 
		database and the results will appear in BRAVO once the upload is complete. <br/>
		<i>Upload Software Discrepancy</i> - This will allow you to upload a standard file for mass loading 
		missing software discrepancies or manually collected installed software where an automated scan is 
		unavailable. The file will go into a queue for loading to the database and the results will appear in 
		BRAVO once the upload is complete. <br/>
		<i>Upload Soft Audit Software</i> - This will allow you to upload a SoftAudit scan file directly to the 
		asset management server. The file will go into a queue for loading to the database and the results will 
		appear in BRAVO once the upload is complete. <br/>
		<i>Upload VM Software</i> - This will allow you to upload a VM scan file directly to the asset management 
		server. The file will go into a queue for loading to the database and the results will appear in BRAVO 
		once the upload is complete. <br/>
		<i>Copy This LPAR</i> - Steps for using this feature during a mainframe recon.
		<ul>
<li>Validate Software Products on LPAR to be copied "from"</li>
<li>After this validation is complete, in the Lpar Detail page, click on the Copy This LPAR link under Actions</li>
<li>You will then see a list of other LPARs on the same account.  Select one or many LPARs ON THE SAME CPU as the "from" LPAR that you would like to copy "to" by selecting the check box to the left of the LPAR name.</li>
<li>Click Copy at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>You will receive an email informing you that your copy is in progress.</li>
<li>Go back in to the copied "to" LPARs and make any validation changes as necessary.</li>
</ul>
This function will copy ALL product validations on the FROM lpar to each corresponding products on the TO lpar/s.  EXCEPT: It will not copy overtop of any product validation that has all ready been done on the TO lpar/s </br>
The copy is ALL product validations not just the ones for your tower.<br/>

		that have been submitted against the software.<br/>
		<i>Account Assets</i> : This report will provide you with the listing of all Hardware and Software LPARs 
		that exist in BRAVO as well as a flag for if the HW LPAR and SW LPAR exist. Addiitonally, the scan date is
		available where the SW LPAR is present.<br/>
		<i>Software Multi Report</i> : This report is the standard report package for all active installed software. 
		The package contains one file with three tabs for each set of data. The Heartbeat tab provides the listing of
		SW LPARs that exist in BRAVO that are Active. The Product Count tab provides a count of each software product
		that was found on the account by operating system. The Software tab provides a complete list of software that 
		is installed across each machine. If any software product was given a discrepancy of "Invalid" or "False Hit"  
		OR and product is inactive (removed from the machine) it will not be displayed in the report.<br/>
