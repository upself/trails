<H3><A name="_What_is_SIGNATURE"></A>What is Signature Bank?</H3>
<P>The Signature Bank tool is your one stop shop for
software knowledge base research and administration. From this Web
interface you can administer the current signature repository, search
the filter library, edit the software catalog, and manage signature
replication to software inventory scanning infrastructures throughout
IBM.</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_the"></A>What is the software knowledge base in
the Signature Bank?</H3>
<P>The IBM SW knowledge base includes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Catalog of SW
	manufacturers and products</LI>
	<LI>Intellectual
	capital enabling automated installed SW inventories ready for asset
	management and other business purposes</LI>
	<LI>Data referenced to
	map, filter, consolidate or otherwise convert raw SW data collected
	from a scanning technology into a useful SW inventory</LI>


</UL>
<H3><A name="_Where_did_the"></A>Where did the data in Signature Bank
come from?</H3>
<P>The Global Signature Bank Team can perform updates
and add information, as necessary. Signature Bank Team members also
manage manufacturer, software, software category, and bank account
information. Additionally they upload signature and filter files and
manage reports and historical information.</P>
<H3><A name="_Who_is_the"></A>Who is the Signature Bank team?</H3>
<P>The Signature Bank Team&#39;s mission is to improve and
maintain quality and completeness of the IBM knowledge base used for
software (SW) detection, including SW products installed on the
mainframe and distributed platforms.</P>
<H3><A name="_How_can_I"></A>How can I access Signature Bank?</H3>
<P>There are two types of access; read and
administrative access. By default, the Asset Management community has
read access. If you are outside this group and need either read or
administrative access, go the Asset Management PR database and submit a
service request ticket to the Signature bank tool. Include your e-mail
address in the format, IBMer@us.ibm.com in the request.</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_a"></A>What is a Signature Bank Account?</H3>
<P>Bank accounts represent software inventory scanning
infrastructure which are used as a source of software inventory data.</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_a_1"></A>What is a Signature?</H3>
<P>A signature is a specific file name and file size
that is linked to a product in the signature bank catalog. This file, if
found installed on a system, identifies that a particular software
product and version is installed. The best option for a signature is an
executable file installed that initiates a software product.</P>
<P>For example,</P>
<P>Ex SW Signature File</P>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>File Name (key exe file)</td><td>ex. EXCEED.EXE</td></tr>
<tr><td>File Size in Bytes</td><td>ex. 5337088</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software Product Name</td><td>ex. Hummingbird Exceed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software Version</td><td>ex. 2.1</td></tr>
</table>
<H3><A name="_What_is_a_2"></A>What is a filter?</H3>
<P>A filter is a product description and version that
is linked to a product in the signature bank catalog. A filter is
matched against the registry information of a system after a scan has
been completed to identify if software is installed.</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_the_1"></A>What is the difference between a
manufacturer and a vendor in Signature Bank?</H3>
<P>The manufacturer is the company that created the
application&#39;s code. The vendor is the name of the company that sells the
application. There may also be multiple vendors for any application.
Signature Bank asks for manufacturer names as opposed to vendor names,
so be sure you type manufacturer names into the appropriate fields in
the tool.</P>
<H3><A name="_How_long_does"></A>How long does it take for changes I make to reflect
in Signature Bank?</H3>
<P>Changes you make in Signature Bank are immediate.
Changes made are also reflected in the BRAVO application after a full
reload has occurred (usually a daily occurrence).</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_a_3"></A>What is a software category?</H3>
<P>A software category (hierarchy) was created in
Signature Bank to identify multiple products that are separate versions
of each other (for example, Microsoft SQL Advanced Edition and Microsoft
SQL Standard Edition) and give them a priority. The tools reporting
installed software such as TRAILS or the Microsoft Wizard only report on
the highest priority product in the list, if multiple products are
discovered in a scan.</P>
<P>Code is often reused from version to version by
manufacturers of software. What can happen when code is reused is that
the scan picks up the current version as well as the lower version of
the software as installed. In some cases the lower and higher versions
of a product fall under different names and would show up as two line
items in a scan report. This can cause a licensing issue. Only the
higher of the two versions would need to be licensed and thus only the
higher should be reported as installed.</P>
<H3><A name="_What_is_the_2"></A>What is the Software License Level
field in Signature Bank? What is a software component? What is a
software bundle?</H3>
<P>This field is where you indicate whether the
software you want to add is licensable, un-licensable, or a component of
another family of software. Generally, if you can purchase a product,
then it is licensable. Unlicensable software is freeware or any other
software packages that do not require a procured license. A component is
a software package which comes as part of a licensable software product.
A component would never be installed apart from its parent, licensable
software product; and would never require its own procured license. The
component is similar, but not identical to, a software bundle. A
software bundle is when a licensable software product comes free with
another licensable software product; but would not be free if it were
installed as a standalone product.</P>
<H3><A name="_Can_Signature_Bank"></A>Can Signature Bank data be
distributed externally?</H3>
<P>No. Data should not be shared with anyone outside
of IBM, including software manufacturers, vendors, and customers.
